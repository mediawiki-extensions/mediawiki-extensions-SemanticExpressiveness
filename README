== About ==

~~ THIS IS NOT A FINAL RELEASE YET, ITS CONSIDERED AN ALPHA VERSION BY NOW ~~

The 'Semantic Expressiveness' extension is an enhancement for 'Semantic MediaWiki'.
Its main feature is to introduce a new syntax for inline short queries. The purpose
of this simplest form of inline query is to fight redundancies within the wiki.
Without 'Semantic Expressivenss' it is customary to declare properties in one place
but using the same information again all over the same article or on other pages.
With 'Semantic Expressiveness' it is possible to use simple references in form of a
new syntax to place the same information in various places without writing redundant
information. This way if the property changes, the information will update itself
all over the wiki wherever the new syntax is in place.
There are also further features like parser functions for template developers and a
JavaScript context popup using AJAX to display further information on cross-article
inline queries.

== Installation ==

Once you have downloaded the code, place the 'SemanticExpressiveness' directory within
your MediaWiki 'extensions' directory. Then add the following code to your
[[Manual:LocalSettings.php|LocalSettings.php]] file:

 # Semantic Expressiveness
 require_once( "$IP/extensions/SemanticExpressiveness/SemanticExpressiveness.php" );
 
This extension requires Jeroen De Dauws 'Validator' extension (version 0.4.14 or
above). It must be included before the 'Semantic Expressiveness' extension.
You can get it at: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Validator

Furthermore, PHP 5.3+ is required and currently it is necessary to apply a patch for
MediaWiki bug #34678 manually:
