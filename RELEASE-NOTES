 'Semantic Expressiveness' Changelog:
 =====================================
 
 * Version 0.1 alpha
   ~~ THIS IS NOT A FINAL RELEASE YET ~~
   
   - Syntax for so called inline short queries, basically "<?property::page>" with a few advanced
     syntactical features like nested "<?A::<?B::page>>" or "<?A::B::page>". This syntax is getting
	 parsed after template execution and fully respects nowiki, noincude, comments, pre and others.
   - Parser function version of the new syntax called "?" with advanced parameters.
   - Extensive JavaScript allowing to display information from a short queries source page like the
     pages fact box or any other content. Might need some configuration for custom wiki adjustment.
   - "?to?!" (might be renamed later) parser function allowing to parse the short query syntax early
     to give template programmers full control.
   - "SemExExpressiveString" class, extendable parser for the new syntax, also recognizes wikilinks.
